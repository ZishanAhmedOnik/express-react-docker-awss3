# Express React Docker AWS S3

This repo demonstrates my knowledge of the **MERN** stack.

I'm not really sure what I'm building in here... but the final product will be something like a clone of netflix or youtbue.

Users will be able to upload video files, the uploaded files will be stored on a **AWS S3 Bucket**. The uploaded video will also be converted to **HLS** format using **AWS Elemental MediaConvert** to facilitate on demand streaming.

So this is the basic idea.. lets see where it goes... :/
